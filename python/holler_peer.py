# holler_peer.py -- an independent, single-file Python peer for the holler
# peer-to-peer agent messaging protocol, SPEC.md "draft 1" (2026-09-25).
#
# Written from the spec text alone, to serve as an interop test partner for the
# Go reference implementation.  It speaks the non-tailcat bindings of section
# 4.2: plain TCP and Unix stream sockets.  Ed25519 comes from the `cryptography`
# package; if that is missing (or HOLLER_PURE_ED25519=1 is set) a pure-Python
# RFC 8032 implementation is used instead.
#
# CLI (test-driver contract):
#   python3 holler_peer.py --state DIR [--name NAME] [--ping-interval SECS] listen ADDR
#   python3 holler_peer.py --state DIR [--name NAME] [--ping-interval SECS] connect ADDR
#   ADDR is tcp:HOST:PORT or unix:/path/to/socket
# Optional extras: --max-blob BYTES (receive limit, default 50 MiB),
#   --trust KEY (repeatable; grant issuers to trust), --about TEXT, -v (debug log).
# Environment: HOLLER_FSYNC=0 skips fsync (still safe against kill -9, only
#   power loss needs fsync); HOLLER_PURE_ED25519=1 forces the fallback crypto.
#

#   {"cmd":"quit"}                       exit immediately, no bye
#   any command may add "peer":"ed25519:..." to pick the target peer (extension)
#   stdin EOF: keep running until killed.

# ============================================================================
# SPEC AMBIGUITIES (and how this implementation resolves them)
# ============================================================================
# Framing and envelope (sections 5, 6)
#  A1. "Maximum line length: 1 MiB": read as at most 1,048,576 bytes of content,
#      excluding the terminating "\n".  Longer: send `err too_large`, close.
#      Outbound: a send/state command whose line would exceed 1 MiB is rejected
#      locally with an `error` event (send it as a blob).
#  A2. `too_large` has no stated close behaviour (9.7 says "stated per code above",
#      but it never is).  It is not in the non-closing list, and after an
#      over-long line the framing cannot be trusted, so we close.  Closing codes
#      are therefore bad_frame, version, auth, too_large.  An `err` with a code we
#      do not know is treated as non-closing.  When we receive a closing err we
#      close too.
#  A3. Empty or whitespace-only lines are skipped instead of being `bad_frame`
#      (liberal).  A "\r" before "\n" stays part of the line bytes (it matters
#      for the hello bytes that get signed); JSON parsing tolerates it.
#  A4. Invalid UTF-8, invalid JSON, or valid JSON that is not an object ->
#      `bad_frame` + close.  A JSON object with a missing or non-string `t` is
#      treated as an unknown message type and ignored, which is the literal reading
#      of section 5.
#  A5. We never send `unsupported`.  Unknown types are logged, emitted as `recv`
#      events and otherwise ignored.
#  A6. Ids: ULIDs, monotonic per process: within one millisecond the random part
#      is incremented.  The generator is seeded from the highest id in our outbox
#      logs at startup, so a restart with a clock that went backwards still gives
#      increasing ids.  "ids greater than the seen id" is plain string comparison.
#      That works for fixed-length ULIDs, and we only ever compare our own ids.
#      Note: resume silently depends on each sender's ids growing in send order,
#      which is a hard requirement although the spec only "recommends" ULID/UUIDv7.
#  A7. Timestamps: examples use whole seconds; we send UTC with milliseconds
#      ("2026-09-25T17:03:11.123Z").  Incoming `ts` is never interpreted.  Grant
#      `exp` is emitted at whole seconds (rounded up) and any RFC 3339 form is
#      accepted: any number of fraction digits, "Z" or a numeric offset.
#  A8. msg/state that lack `id` or `th` are still delivered (a `recv` event) but
#      cannot be acked (an ack needs both) or deduplicated.
#
# Handshake (section 7)
#  B1. base64url padding is not specified.  We send unpadded base64url (43 chars
#      for keys and nonces, 86 for signatures).  We accept padded or unpadded input,
#      either alphabet, and ignore embedded whitespace, everywhere.
#  B2. "Its byte encoding is the peer identity": the identity is the 32 raw key
#      bytes, so two spellings of the same key are the same peer.  The "ed25519:"
#      prefix is matched case-insensitively.  The `connected` event echoes the
#      key string exactly as the peer sent it.
#  B3. `caps`: the text says "chat and resume are mandatory and not listed", but
#      both examples list "chat".  We send ["chat","blob","grant"] as in the
#      examples.  On receipt we treat chat and resume as always supported whether
#      listed or not.  We do not stop sending chunks to a peer that omits "blob";
#      we only log it.
#  B4. `v` missing -> treated as 0.  `v` must be the number 0 (true/"0" are
#      rejected).  The version is checked when hello arrives, before we send auth.
#  B5. Signature bytes: "holler-auth-v0" 0x00 <signer's own hello line> 0x00 <the
#      other side's hello line>.  Lines are the exact bytes as written or read,
#      without the "\n".
#  B6. The transcript is symmetric.  If a peer echoes our own hello back, the
#      signed string for its side is byte-identical to ours, so it could replay
#      our auth and pass.  We reject (with `err auth`) any hello that carries our
#      own key or is byte-identical to our hello.
#  B7. Before the handshake completes: msg/state/ack/chunk/resume/grant/introduce
#      -> `err auth` + close; ping/pong and unknown types are ignored; `bye` just
#      closes.  A repeated hello or auth is ignored.
#  B8. `connected` is emitted once we have sent our auth and verified theirs.  We
#      cannot see the peer's verification of ours; if it fails, its err closes us.
#  B9. Grants in `auth` are verified and stored; a bad grant does not fail auth.
#      We present all unexpired grants we hold (sub == our key) in our own auth.
#  B10. Policy (7.3): accept any key and log it.  Handshake timeout 20 s.  Each
#      --state dir gets its own fresh key, and its fingerprint goes in `about`
#      (section 13).
#
# Threads and messages (sections 8, 9)
#  C1. "Open thread" (4.3 reconnect rule) is undefined.  A thread is open once any
#      msg/state has gone either way in it, until the most recent state message in
#      either direction is "closed".  A later msg or state reopens it.  done and
#      failed stay open because they are one side's view.
#  C2. We do not make up a `subject` when the send command gives none.
#  C3. Acks: sent for every msg/state, including re-acks of duplicates; ack.th
#      copies the message's th.  An ack for an unknown id is ignored.  Acks for
#      chunk ids are accepted and prune the chunk.  We never ack chunks, since acks
#      are mandatory only for msg and state.
#  C4. "Durably received": for msg and state we emit `recv`, then append the id to
#      inbox.log (fsync), then ack.  So kill -9 can at worst cause one repeated
#      `recv` after restart (at-least-once), never a loss.
#  C5. `recv` events go out for every inbound message except ping/pong (including
#      hello/auth/resume/ack/err/bye/grant/unknown types), but NOT for
#      deduplicated replays of msg/state/chunk, so consumers see each message once.
#
# Chunks and blobs (9.3)
#  D1. Base64 alphabet and padding for `data` are unspecified ("base64", not
#      "base64url"): we send standard base64 with padding and accept any variant.
#  D2. The 9.3 example chunk has no `th`, yet 12.1 shows a chunk replayed from the
#      outbox, and replay is per thread.  We put the `th` of the carrying msg on
#      every chunk we send (the envelope allows `th` on any type).  Chunks live in
#      the outbox and are replayed by the thread rule.  We accept chunks with or
#      without `th`.
#  D3. Chunks are never acked, but "a sender ... MUST keep it until [acked]".
#      Our outbox drops chunk entries when (a) the msg with the blob part is acked
#      (we send the chunks before that msg, so on an ordered stream its ack means
#      they were all processed), (b) the peer's resume `seen` covers them, or
#      (c) the peer sends blob_refused.
#  D4. Order: we send chunks first, then the msg with the blob part.  Both orders
#      are accepted on receipt ("before or after this message").
#  D5. Receiver: dedup by id first.  Then per ref: n < expected is a duplicate and
#      is skipped; n > expected is a gap: `err internal` (non-closing), chunk
#      dropped.  A missing `n` is taken as the expected one, and a missing `last`
#      as false.  Partial blobs are kept on disk, so a restarted receiver resumes
#      mid-blob.  After a crash, a partial file longer than the logged progress is
#      truncated back to it.
#  D6. The blob limit (default 50 MiB) is checked against the declared `size` of
#      a blob part when the msg arrives first, and against the decoded bytes
#      received.  A refusal is `err` code blob_refused with `ref`, and `re` set to
#      the offending id.  Chunk data that is not valid base64 is refused the same
#      way, since no non-closing code fits better.  Further chunks of a refused ref
#      are ignored quietly.
#  D7. Completed blobs go to DIR/blobs/<peer fp>/<sanitised ref>.  Refs are scoped
#      to the sending peer.  A ref that already finished ignores later chunks.
#
# Ping (9.4)
#  E1. "Idle" means no inbound frame for ping-interval seconds.  Any inbound frame
#      counts as liveness.  A ping is "missed" when nothing arrives within one
#      interval.  After the 2nd miss the connection is dead, so a silent peer is
#      dropped about 3 intervals after its last frame.  --ping-interval 0 turns
#      pinging off.
#
# Resume (9.5, 4.3)
#  F1. The seen map we send lists, per thread, the last replayable id (msg, state,
#      or chunk with th) received, in arrival order.  The 12.1 example shows an
#      ACK id ("a9") used as a seen value.  We accept that, but we do not record
#      acks ourselves: an ack that overtakes an older queued msg in the same thread
#      would otherwise make its sender skip that msg on replay.  Recording less
#      only causes harmless extra replays.
#  F2. Since a peer may record acks (F1), our own sending never lets a newer id
#      overtake an older replayable one in a thread.  One FIFO writer carries
#      outbox entries and acks.  Acks created before the peer's resume arrives
#      are held until our replay has been queued.  ping/pong/err have no th and
#      skip the queue.
#  F3. Seen as an implicit ack: outbox entries with id <= seen[th] are treated as
#      acknowledged.  They are pruned and an `acked` event is emitted.  The replay
#      rule would never resend them, so if their ack was lost they could otherwise
#      never be pruned.  Safety valve: a seen value that is not a ULID cannot
#      name one of our ids, so for that thread we skip pruning and replay the
#      whole thread; receivers dedup.  Anything left in the outbox after this
#      is replayed, which is exactly the entries with id > seen.
#  F4. Resume is processed once per connection.  If the peer sends none within
#      10 s we act as if seen were {} and replay everything; duplicates are safe.
#  F5. Entries without th would be replayed under "threads the other side did not
#      list".  Our outbox never has any: grant messages are not thread messages and
#      are never acked, so they sit in a separate durable queue and are sent once
#      after the next resume.
#  F6. Retention: outbox entries stay until acked, however long that takes.  The
#      "until closed or 7 days" idea in open question 2 is not adopted.
#
# Reconnection (4.3)
#  G1. The connecting side always retries until its first successful handshake.
#      After that it reconnects only while it has unacked outbox entries, queued
#      grants or open threads.  Backoff: 0.5 s doubling to a 60 s cap, with +/-10%
#      jitter, reset after a successful handshake.  No give-up timeout.
#  G2. After a `bye` in either direction we do not reconnect automatically until
#      new outbound work is queued.  bye is an explicit end of the session; the
#      state stays on disk and the next connection resumes it.
#
# bye (9.6)
#  H1. Our bye queues behind writes already queued (graceful).  After writing it
#      we send nothing else, not even acks or pongs.  We close on the peer's bye or
#      after 5 s.  Messages that arrive in the meantime are delivered but not acked,
#      so they will be replayed and deduplicated later.  When the peer says bye
#      first we answer bye at once, echoing its reason, and close.
#
# Grants (section 10)
#  I1. Canonical JSON: keys sorted by code point (recursively), separators "," and
#      ":" with no whitespace, non-ASCII sent raw as UTF-8, minimal escaping
#      (Python json).  When verifying we also accept the ASCII-escaped form and the
#      Go encoding/json HTML-escaped form (\u003c \u003e \u0026 \u2028 \u2029).
#      Numbers are not canonicalised; grants should not contain any.  Every field
#      except `sig` is signed, unknown ones included.
#  I2. exp: RFC 3339 UTC.  Grants with a missing, unparsable or past exp are not
#      honoured.  nonce: 32 random bytes, unpadded base64url.  ttl defaults to 3600.
#  I3. Honouring (10.2): iss is our key, or a --trust key, or iss holds a valid
#      unexpired grant containing "introduce" whose iss is our key or a --trust
#      key.  That supporting grant can come from the same auth, from any grant the
#      peer sent, or from grants we issued.  Only one level of delegation.  `sub`
#      must match the peer's key by raw bytes.
#  I4. A received grant whose sub is our key is kept in grants_held.json and shown
#      in our future auth.  One whose sub is the peer's key is a presented grant.
#      A grant whose sub is someone else is kept only as delegation evidence.
#  I5. Enforcement: the only request shape the spec defines is exec (a data part
#      with mime application/vnd.holler.exec+json).  Without an honoured exec grant
#      we reply `err forbidden` (re = msg id), and we still ack the msg because
#      receipt is not permission.  errs skip the FIFO, so on the wire the err comes
#      before the ack.  With a grant we only log it.  This peer never runs anything.
#  I6. `introduce` is received and logged, and its grant stored.  We never connect
#      to introduced peers on our own.
#
# Multiple peers and transports
#  J1. The outbox, seen map, dedup set and threads are kept per peer key ("for that
#      peer").  Commands go to the peer that most recently authenticated, or to
#      "peer" if given.  Before any peer has ever authenticated they go to a
#      pending queue that the first authenticated peer adopts, with the original
#      ids and timestamps.  A new connection from a key that is already connected
#      replaces the old one.
#  J2. 4.2 says peers SHOULD refuse plaintext TCP across untrusted networks.  We
#      warn on stderr for non-loopback TCP but do not refuse (this is a test peer).
#  J3. `disconnected` is emitted only for connections that reached `connected`.
#      Failed handshakes produce `error` events instead.
#  J4. Commands issued while disconnected get `sent` at once (the message is
#      durably queued).  bye with no live connection -> `error` event.
#  J5. `sent` is emitted for msg, state, grant and bye.  The blob command's `sent`
#      names its msg; chunks get no events.  `acked` is emitted for msg/state only,
#      also when the ack is implied by a resume seen map (F3).
#
# Places where the spec looks wrong or self-contradictory: B3 (caps text vs
# examples), A2 (too_large close rule missing), D2/D3 (chunks have no th and no
# ack, yet sit in a per-thread, ack-pruned outbox), F1 (example uses an ack id as
# seen), B6 (symmetric transcript allows reflection), A6 (resume needs monotonic
# ids but only "recommends" them), 7.2 (auth binds only the hellos, so on
# plaintext bindings later lines are unauthenticated), and section 15's
# subsections being numbered 16.x.
