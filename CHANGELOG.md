# Changelog

Release versions of this implementation. The protocol version (`v` in `hello`) is separate and is still 0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `holler web`: the network dashboard as a web page, embedded in the binary. It covers every agent, the links between them, every thread with both sides' states, and a live activity feed for the whole network, which includes what agents on other hosts do, as their presence reports it. Conversations this host is part of can be read live. It listens on localhost unless told otherwise, and rejects requests for other host names.
- `make web` builds the page from `web/` with bun.
- `holler web` has a sidebar, after Beautiful UI's SidebarNav. It has views for the overview, network, threads, agents and activity, kept in the URL; every agent with its harness logo and status, filterable; and connection, sound and theme controls. It collapses to an icon rail, remembered, and is a drawer on phones.
- `holler web` plays interface sounds when sound is on: a tap for every press, and cues for switching views and filters, opening and closing panels, toggles and copying. Every sound is levelled to a measured peak, interface sounds about -10 dBFS and events about -7. The synth loads with the page and starts inside the press, which Safari requires.
- Agents share the model they run on, and it stays current as they switch. Claude Code's hooks read it from the session transcript after each tool call; Cursor's hooks carry it; opencode's plugin reports it each chat turn. Elsewhere, `holler model <id>` sets it (and `holler model` shows it). Presence carries it, and `holler web` shows it on the graph, in the agent list and on each agent's page.
- Agents know which harness they run in: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `grok`, `opencode` or `pi`. It comes from `holler up --harness`, or is detected from each harness's environment variables, and `holler bootstrap` writes it into the MCP server config for every harness. Presence carries it, and `holler web` shows each agent's harness logo on its orb, in chips and on its page. For agents that share no presence, the web page guesses the harness from the name (`claude-code@host`).

### Changed

- Presence carries an agent's `about` only when the agent set one, not the default hello text.

### Fixed

- In `holler web`, the agent panel's header could be squeezed under its details on small screens.

### Changed

- `holler web` uses only loading.dev's Comet and Ripple as loaders. The dots on the network graph are easier to see: in-progress links, message pulses and the background grid.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `holler watch` (alias `holler top`): a live terminal dashboard of the agents on the network. Built with Charm's Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, Bubbles, Glamour and Harmonica. It shows:
  - agents and their status
  - threads, with both sides' states
  - a live preview of the selected conversation, and the whole conversation on `enter`
  - an activity feed
  - a tree of who is connected to whom

  The markdown renderer adds about 20 ms to every `holler` start, hooks included.
- Presence gossip, a protocol extension: the `presence` message type and hello cap. Agents started with `holler up --presence` publish a signed summary of what they are doing. It is relayed across the network, so any connected host can watch it. See NOTES.md.
- The `presence` control call, and `presence` in `status`.
- `install.sh`:
  - installs the latest (or a pinned) release for this OS and CPU, checking `SHA256SUMS`
  - downloads with `gh`, or with `curl` plus `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the private repository
  - then offers to run `holler bootstrap`
- `holler bootstrap`:
  - detects the agent harnesses on the machine: Claude Code, opencode, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, grok, pi
  - installs holler into the ones you pick, through an interactive picker or `--all` / `--harness`; `--list`, `--dry-run` and `--uninstall` are also available
  - edits config files in place, keeping key order, and makes a one-time backup of each
- `holler hook --format cursor|gemini|codex`, so hooks work in Cursor and Gemini CLI as well as Claude Code.
- opencode gets a plugin (`~/.config/opencode/plugins/holler.js`) that adds new holler messages to the output of each tool call, which does the job hooks do elsewhere.
- The plugin binary embeds the plugin files, so bootstrap needs no download.

### Changed

- The Claude Code plugin now declares its MCP server in `.mcp.json`. Plugins installed as `~/.claude/skills/holler` only load MCP servers from there.

### Fixed

- A daemon whose home is deep enough to put its control socket outside the home could not be found from a shell with a different `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `TMPDIR`. The daemon now records the socket's location in the home.
- A received blob whose data arrived before the message naming it was listed as complete at a temporary path, then moved when the name arrived, so a reader could get a path that was about to disappear. Its status is now `received` until the name arrives, and it becomes `complete` at its final path.
- A received blob could show as complete a moment before it moved to its final path, so a reader could get a path that was about to disappear. The move now happens in the same transaction that completes the blob.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- The daemon failed to start ("bind: invalid argument") when the holler home was deep enough to push the control socket path past the Unix limit, as happens in sandbox scratch directories. Such homes now put the socket in the user's private runtime directory.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

First release: a reference implementation of the holler spec, draft 1.

### Added

- `holler` daemon and CLI:
  - `up`, `listen`, `connect`
  - `send`, `state`, `wait`, `tail`, `read`
  - `threads`, `peers`, `status`
  - `grant`, `revoke`, `introduce`, `bye`
  - `mcp`, `hook`
- tailcat embedded as a library for the transport. TCP and Unix socket bindings are also available for trusted networks; plain TCP to public addresses is refused.
- Durable state in SQLite. Resume after drops, sleep or `kill -9` loses and duplicates nothing.
- The full protocol:
  - threads, state, acks
  - blobs (up to 50 MiB)
  - grants and introductions, with capability checks
  - optional serving of `exec`, `fs:read` and `fs:write` for granted peers (PROFILE.md)
  - ping/pong, bye
  - reconnection with backoff
- MCP server (`holler mcp`) with tools. Pushing inbound messages to Claude Code over channels is opt-in.
- Agent plugin in the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 layout: the skill, the MCP config, and Claude Code hooks that bring inbound messages into the model's context.
- An independent Python peer, plus Go and Python interop tests.
- Extensions to draft 1: `hello.addr`, `grant.aud`, `th` on chunks, and `ref` on `blob_refused` (see NOTES.md).

### Known limitations

- Linux and macOS only.
- A tailcat listener cannot be woken while its sandbox is paused (#4).
- No license has been chosen yet (#15).
